# xSML

Exercism problems in Standard ML

## Testing
Note: your problem implementation must be in a file named <problem-name>.sml

1. cd into your problem directory
2. use the test_<problem-name>.sml file with the SML interpreter of your choice
3. verify that the allTestsPass variable has a true value
   * if so, congrats
   * if not, something is wrong with your implementation of the problem (or the test cases :|)

Example:
 cd ~/exercism/xsml/accumulate
 poly --use accumulate.sml
 (* inspect allTestsPass variable *)

TODO: Find a _better_ way to test SML problems
